/**
    This class is the entry point for using InstantRecord. It aims at registrating which
    database engine to use, and provide useful objects for manipulating storage
 
    Example of registration:

        InstantRecord.setUp(with: CoreDataEngine())
 
    Example of usage:

        let instantRecord = InstantRecord.instance
 
    Example for mocking
 
        let instantRecord = InstantRecord.instanceMock
